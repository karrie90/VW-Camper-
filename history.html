			<h2>History through the years</h2>
				<p>In 1947 the VW Type 2 Bus was born! Dutch importer Ben Pon got the 
				idea from the motorised trolleys used to transport parts around a <strong>VW factory in Wolfsburg</strong>. 
				They were made from stripped down Beetle chassis! <br> This lead to his sketch on 
				23rd April 1947 of a Beetle-based van, slightly resembling a box on wheels! </p>

			<h3>1949</h3>
				<p>A year later when Heinz Nordhoff became the Chief Executive of Volkswagen, 
				he took on this idea.  <br>The first VW van was launched at the Geneva Motor Show in 
				November 1949.</p>

			<h3>1950</h3>
				<p>On 8th March production began at the rate of 10 vehicles per day.  
				For the next four decades, the basic design remained the same and roughly 5 million 
				buses were produced over that time.  <br>The Type 2 filled a much needed gap in the market,
				with its rear engine and box on wheels appearance.  
				The uncomplicated design meant VW was able to turn out 90 different body combinations 
				over the first 5 years. <br> Variations included buses, pick up trucks, fire engines, 
				ambulances, beer wagons, ice cream vans, milk floats and the well known and 
				well loved camper.</p>

			<h3>The Happie Van</h3>
				<p>The VW Type 2 became popular with the counterculture of the 1960s, 
				thanks to its ability to transport a large group of people while being cheap and 
				easy to maintain. Its design was simple yet spacious, thanks largely to the 
				rear-mounted engine. <br>The van became popular with young people because it allowed a 
				group to travel comfortably and was big enough to live in, so it could be used for 
				long-distance journeys, such as to music festivals or surfing locations. 
				It contrasted starkly with the large, low sedans that were normal at the time, 
				giving the van an alternative and rebellious image. Vans were often painted with extravagant 
				designs in bright colors, making them stand out on the road even more. <br>
				The "hippie van" remains iconic today, thanks to being featured of the cover of albums by 
				musicians such as Bob Dylan and the Beach Boys, and being used by fans of the Grateful Dead 
				while following the band on tour. But most iconic of all, the music festival Woodstock, 
				which was held in the summer of 1969, saw plenty of brightly-painted vans transporting excited 
				young crowds<p/>
